New Dynace Classes

1) DynJava - This class is used to start the Java virtual machine (VM)
             in the Dynace process.  It has a single class method
             called gNewJavaVM. (see below) The parameters passed to
             this method determine where the Java VM looks for Java
             classes and native code DLL's.  The first two parameters
             are environment variable names that specify this.  If
             these parameters are wrong, the environment may still
             initialize, but nothing will work.  If the function
             errors, it returns NULL and the third parameter will be
             loaded with a text error message.  The remaining
             parameters are for debugger use and are ignored if NULL.

cmeth gNewJavaVM(char *ClassPathEnv, char *LibPathEnv, char *packageName, 
		     int nDebugJVMPort)

2)  JavaClass - This class wraps a Java class.		   

3)  JavaObject - This class wraps a Java object.

New DLL

1) JavaDynace.dll - This is used for callbacks to Dynace from Java
                    code.  The path to this dll must be specified in
                    the environment variable whose name is passed in
                    the LibPathEnv parameter for gNewJavaVM.

New Java Classes - The path to these class files must be specified in
                   the environment variable whose name is passed in
                   the ClassPathEnv parameter for gNewJavaVM.  The
                   path to any custom java code called from Dynace
                   must also be present in this environment variable.

1)  DynaceBase.class
4)  DynaceClass.class
5)  DynaceGeneric.class
