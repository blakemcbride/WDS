Running the example
-------------------

path c:\j2sdk1.4.0\bin;C:\j2sdk1.4.0\jre\bin\client;%path%

wds -j .;../java/Dynace.jar ../dll Dynace.generics wdsexam08 start


Creating new Dynace Objects from Java
-------------------------------------

DynaceObject x = new DynaceObject(LongInteger.gNewWithLong(6));

DynaceObject x = LongInteger.gNewWithLong(6);

The first example will cause Java to Dispose of the Dynace object
when the Java object (x) gets garbage collected.  The second
will not auto-dispose the Dynace object when X gets collected.


Inheriting from Dynace
----------------------

Java classes which inherit from Dynace can do the following:

LongInteger.gNewWithLong(6);

Otherwise you'd have to do:

Dynace.LongInteger.gNewWithLong(6);


Runtime environment needed
--------------------------
The following files are needed at runtime:
    Dynace.jar
    JavaDynace.dll
        &
    PATH set to include jre\bin\client
    (which contains jvm.dll)

No other environment variables are needed.  Java figures everything
out from the relative location of the jvm.dll (i.e. you can't change
the relative path of jvm.dll with respect to the other jre files)
