This example builds on the previous example by correctly initializing
and using the text controls (entry fields) within the modal dialog.
Note that the remaining controls will remain minimally functional
untill later examples.

Text controls (entry fields) are defined by the resource editor as
normal edit controls.

Note that this example only illustrates a fraction of the many flexable
things which may be done with text controls.


Remember that a commented version of MAIN.C is in MAIN.TXT.


Note that a full description of all files and instructions on how to
configure, build and run this example appear in full detail in the
README file located in the first example.
