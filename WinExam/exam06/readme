This example builds on the previous example by correctly initializing
and using a push button control within the modal dialog.  Note that
the remaining controls will remain minimally functional until later
examples.

Bush button controls are defined by the resource editor as normal push
button controls.

Be sure to see example 04.  It documents the basic use and structure
of the init_controls(), and displayValues() functions.

Note that this example only illustrates a fraction of the many flexable
things which may be done with these controls.


Remember that a commented version of MAIN.C is in MAIN.TXT.


Note that a full description of all files and instructions on how to
configure, build and run this example appear in full detail in the
README file located in the first example.
