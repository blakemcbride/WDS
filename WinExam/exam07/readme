This example builds on the previous example by correctly initializing
and using a check box and radio button controls within the modal
dialog.  Note that the remaining controls will remain minimally
functional until later examples.

Note that this example only utilizes the first of two check boxes located
in the dialog and the first of two sets of radio controls in the dialog.

Radio buttons and check boxes are treated very similar.  The main
difference between the two is that check boxes are not mutually
exclusive and radio buttons (within groups) are.  That is with radio
buttons the user may only select one of a group.

Radio buttons and check boxes are defined by the resource editor as
normal radio button and check box controls.  You can control the
grouping of radio buttons when defining them with the resource editor.
The first button of each group should have its group flag enabled.

Be sure to see example 04.  It documents the basic use and structure
of the init_controls(), and displayValues() functions.

Note that this example only illustrates a fraction of the many flexable
things which may be done with these controls.


Remember that a commented version of MAIN.C is in MAIN.TXT.


Note that a full description of all files and instructions on how to
configure, build and run this example appear in full detail in the
README file located in the first example.
