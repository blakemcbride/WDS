This example combines all the dialog control usage into one example
program.  It simply includes a merging of all the code in all the
previous modal examples to show a complete example.


This example has no MAIN.TXT file because it is completely documented
by all the previous examples.

Note that a full description of all files and instructions on how to
configure, build and run this example appear in full detail in the
README file located in the first example.
