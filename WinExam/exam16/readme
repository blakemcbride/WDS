This example is a duplicate of example 04 except that now a modeless
dialog is used instead of a modal dialog.  With a modeless dialog, the
user may go to more than one place in the app at a time.  Once the
dialog comes up the user may then switch to other windows within the
application.  Also, multiple copies of the same dialog can be active
at one time.

Remember that a commented version of MAIN.C is in MAIN.TXT.


Note that a full description of all files and instructions on how to
configure, build and run this example appear in full detail in the
README file located in the first example.
