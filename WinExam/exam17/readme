This example is a duplicate of the previous example except that now the
modeless dialog is set up without a parent window association.  This
allows the dialog to go behind the main application window and act
independently of the main application window.

Notice how since the main app window is not it's parent anymore, we
will attach the main window as a tag (which isn't used by the dialog)
just so we can gain access to this object later.

Remember that a commented version of MAIN.C is in MAIN.TXT.


Note that a full description of all files and instructions on how to
configure, build and run this example appear in full detail in the
README file located in the first example.
