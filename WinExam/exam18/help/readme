readme			This file

clean.bat		Remove all created files to restore the system to
			the as-shipped state.

make.bat		Batch file used to create the actual compiled help
			file used by the example (myhelp.hlp).  This uses the
			help compiler which is part of the 16 bit C compiler.
			The resulting help file is compatable with Win16 and
			Win32 systems.

make32.bat		Batch file used to create the actual compiled help
			file used by the example (myhelp.hlp).  This uses the
			help compiler which is part of the 32 bit C compiler.
			The resulting help file is only compatable with Win32 
			systems (NT & 95).

myhelp.hpj		A help project file which is used to describe all the
			files which make up the final compiled help file.

myhelp.rtf		The text portion of the help file.  This file is in
			whats called "rich text format" and is partially
			described in the compiler documentation.  There
			are also many third party help authoring tools
			which can be used to create this file.

myhelp.hlp		This is the compiled help file which gets created
			when you execute the make.bat batch file.  It
			includes the entire contents of the help file and
			is the only file actually needed by the application.


On NT use winhlp32.exe to view Win16 or Win32 format help files.
winhelp.exe can only be used to view Win16 help files.
