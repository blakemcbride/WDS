This example takes example 04 and adds the help facility.  This example
has a help subdirectory which contains the help text and build procedure.
See the readme file in that directory and build the compiled help file
prior to attempting to run this example.


Note that this example adds the Help option to the menu in order to
illustrate a method of accessing help through a Help menu option.
Notice also that the Help option has an underline under the H.  This
allows the user to access a menu option via the control-H.  This is
done when in the resource editor by putting an & before the key
letter.  The user may the access that option by typing control and
whatever letter was underlined.

Help is normally accessed via the F1 key at any point or via a help
menu option.  This example illustrates context sensitive help via
global F1 key, menu option, dialog specific and finally control
specific.  The WDS help system has additional capabilities.  See the
manual.


Remember that a commented version of MAIN.C is in MAIN.TXT.


Note that a full description of all files and instructions on how to
configure, build and run this example appear in full detail in the
README file located in the first example.
