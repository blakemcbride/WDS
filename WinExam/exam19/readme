This example illustrates how to create your own Dynace classes in conjunction
with the WDS.  There are three main differences between this example and
all the other WDS examples.

1.  The makefiles (*.dm) have been enhanced to include the class
making logic.  For this reason, thses make files are different from
all the other WDS examples.  Note also that the IDEs should no longer
be used (unless you can get the foreign make facility to work with
them).  The makefiles for this example are stored under the "make"
subdirectory to this example.  Edit those makefiles as needed.

2.  Your application will now contain custom generics.h, generics.c and
generics.obj files.  These will be automatically built and maintained by
the supplied make files and dpp program.

The example in this directory is basically a merging between WDS
example 01 and the Dynace example 15.  See those examples for
additional documentation.

If you want to run this example from the Microsoft IDE you will first have
to set the executable file to main.exe using Project/Settings.  Go to the
DEBUG tab and change the executable for debug to main.exe

(To build see the readme file in the first example.)
