This example shows the use of the Dynace ODBC classes.  Documentation
for these classes is located in the accompanying ODBC User manual.

There is a bug in the 16 bit ODBC library distributed by Microsoft.
The problem is that the odbc.lib distributed was created with mixed case
functions, however, they are declared pascal which requires all upper
case.  The problem can be fixed by creating a new and correct odbc.lib
from odbc.dll.  Using odbc.dll located in your \windows\system directory
execute the following line:

	implib  odbc.lib  odbc.dll

This will create a new (and correct) odbc.lib from odbc.dll.
You can then copy the new odbc.lib to your \msvc\lib directory.

Note that a full description of all files and instructions on how to
configure, build and run this example appear in full detail in the
README file located in the first example.
