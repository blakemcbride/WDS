such that when the control is left, a function is executed.  It also
demonstrates how to update another field while a dialog is running
and how to set a display only field.

This example also shows the most portable way to set up a right

Remember that a commented version of MAIN.C is in MAIN.TXT.


Note that a full description of all files and instructions on how to
