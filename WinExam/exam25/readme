This example illustrates the use of toolbars and status bars.

The actual bitmaps are defined in MAIN.RC by use of the resource
editor which comes with your compiler (App Studio for Microsoft).
(See the documentation included with that utility.)


Remember that a commented version of MAIN.C is in MAIN.TXT.


Note that a full description of all files and instructions on how to
configure, build and run this example appear in full detail in the
README file located in the first example.
