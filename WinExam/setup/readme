All examples are buildable under all supported environments and build
procedures, including IDE or DMAKE builds, as well as 16 bit Windows
or 32 bit Win32.  The only difference is the build procedures or
associated makefiles.

In order to avoid having all supported build procedures cluttering up
the example directories, the example directories are shipped without
any build procedures installed.  All the build procedures are located
in the WINEXAM\SETUP directory along with batch files used to install
the specific build procedures you need.

The following table lists the commands available in order to configure
the example programs.  Note that each command must be executed from
the WINEXAM\SETUP directory unless otherwise indicated.  There is no
harm in configuring the examples for more than one configuration at
the same time.


M16IDE
IDE build with Microsoft Visual C 16 bit

M16DM
DMAKE build with Microsoft Visual C 16 bit

M32IDE
IDE build with Microsoft Visual C 32 bit

M32DM
DMAKE build with Microsoft Visual C 32 bit

CLEANALL
Used to delete all files produced by builds in all examples

REALCLN
Used to delete all files produced by builds and all build configuration
files (basically to go back to an as-shipped state)

CLEAN
Used to delete all files produced by a build for a single example
(execute from the particular example's directory)
