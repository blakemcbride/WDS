To rebuild the libraries use:

dmake -d MAKEFILE.DM NEW=1       (the first time)
	or
dmake -d MAKEFILE.DM	         (thereafter)

where MAKEFILE.DM is one of:

M16.DM		Microsoft 16 bit
M32.DM		Microsoft 32 bit
B16.DM		Borland 16 bit
B32.DM		Borland 32 bit
S32.DM		Symantec 32 bit


The BORLAND_HOME path needs to be edited in B16.DM or B32.DM prior to use.

Debug libraries may be produced as follows:

dmake -d MAKEFILE.DM  DEBUG=1

If you want to build for a different dpp Strategy use (like S1):

dmake -f MAKEFILE.DM  STRAT=-S1 newgens  (regenerates the .c files)
dmake -f MAKEFILE.DM  STRAT=-S1

You should, however, rebuild ../generics with the selected strategy first!


There is also a clean.bat batch file which will clean all the garbage files
or you can use:

dmake -f MAKEFILE.DM  clean
