This example builds on the previous example by the addition of a modal
dialog (or data entry screen).  While the dialog in this example will
function, it will do so at a very fundemental level.  This example is
designed merely to illustrate the minimum steps necessary to get a dialog
loaded and running.  Subsequent example programs will add real
functionality to this dialog.

There are two types of dialogs, modal and modeless.  Modal dialogs
require the user to complete the screen before they can switch to
another window within the same app.  This prevents the user from
having multiple copies of the same screen active at the same time (a
difficult situation to handle sometimes).  Modeless dialogs allow the
user to leave the dialog active and go back to the main window and go
into another section of the app (or a duplicate of the same section!).
Dynace WDS supports both types of dialogs.

The actual dialog is defined in MAIN.RC by use of the resource
editor which comes with your compiler (App Studio for Microsoft).
(See the documentation included with that utility.)
MAIN.C is modified to use the defined dialog.

Note that an additional menu option "Dialog" was added to the menu.

Remember that a commented version of MAIN.C is in MAIN.TXT.


Note that a full description of all files and instructions on how to
configure, build and run this example appear in full detail in the
README file located in the first example.
