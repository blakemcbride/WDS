Since I do most of my development on Windows there are some steps I've
found which make it easier to port to unix as follows:

delcr makefile.unx makfile.inc dropunx.sh mkfile.inc mkfile
delcr bin/delcr.c
dmake -f m32.dm realclean
dmake -f m32.dm all-scratch
dmake -f m32.dm STRAT=-S2 newgens
dmake -f m32.dm realclean
delete all .exe files
