This example demonstrates the minimum steps necessary to compile and
link a program which correctly initializes the Dynace system.

The remaining instructions in this file should be followed for
all the other examples.  They will not be repeated.


To compile the example with the Microsoft, WATCOM or Borland compilers
use the following command:

	dmake -f MAKEFILE.DM

where MAKEFILE.DM is one of the following:

	M16.DM		Microsoft C 16 bit
	MSC.DM		Microsoft C 32 or 64 bit
	W32.DM		WATCOM C 32 bit

In addition, the following command can be used to build with debugging
information:

	dmake -f MAKEFILE.DM  DEBUG=1


To compile the example under UNIX/Linux with the GNU C compiler use:

	make -f makefile.unx

(or just 'make' if you've removed the .unx extensions)


The make process will create a stand-alone executable named main.exe
which may be executed to run the example.


To return the directory to its initial state (delete all the created
files) use the following:

	dmake -f MAKEFILE.DM  clean



The DMAKE utility is documented in \DYNACE\DOCS\DMAKE.MAN


Note that the file ..\list contains the most up-to-date list of example
programs.

After this example, you will want to continue in numeric order with
all the example programs located at:

	examples/exam??/readme

(where ?? is the example number)
