This example demonstrates the value and correct initialization procedure
for the automatic garbage collector.

The first time it is run the system will run out of memory because a
large number of objects are created but never disposed.

After the first run you need to un-comment the line indicated in main.c
and re-compile and link to see what happens when the GC is turned on.

(To build see the readme file in the first example.)
