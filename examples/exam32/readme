This example demonstrates how to locally cache a method lookup so
as to totally avoid the runtime overhead of future multiple lookups.

Note that the reason that it's ok to use it here is that since it's
being used with the exact same object over and over the method would
not change.  If print_method is used on an object which is not an
instance of the same class as myObj unpredictable results will happen
because print_method may not be the method which is associated with
the new object and the gPrint generic.  There is no lookup when using
print_method.


(To build see the readme file in the first example.)
