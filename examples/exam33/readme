This example demonstrates most of the methods associated with the String
class.

This is also a good example of why a garbage collector is needed.  If none
was available all the intermediate or temporary string objects would
have to be accounted for and manually disposed.  This would be a real
pain!


(To build see the readme file in the first example.)
